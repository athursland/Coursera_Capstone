This is the research question I will be addressing in my capstone project. Durham is the 4th largest city in the state of North Carolina; located in the famous Research Triangle, it is renowned for its scholarly initiatives and research pursuits. However, for the locals, Durham is also well-known as a cradle of culinary delight. It has been hailed as the \u201cTastiest Town in America\u201d by Southern Living Magazine and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Foodiest Small Town\u201d by Bon Appetit. From Latin to Asian fusion to southern and everything in between, Durham\u2019s got it all."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The main data needed for this problem is geospatial and venue data obtained using the Foursquare API. We learned about Foursquare during this capstone course and it has proven to be a valuable, versatile resource. Using this API, we can access a wealth of location data with precise positioning, information on businesses, restaurants and other establishments, and user feedback about each of these venues. Specifically, I plan to use Foursquare to locate every restaurant in Durham. Then, I will use a k-nearest neighbor algorithm to predict the user ratings my restaurant could expect to receive based on its location. I may decide to extend my research further and consider whether I could do better opening a different sort of business from my home: a salon, or a jeweler perhaps? Then, I might compare the predicted user ratings of these different hypothetical businesses to each other to see which venture I should pursue."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
